    <div id="about">
      <p>
        I'm a Junior in the School of Information Technology and I am going after a
        Bachelors degree with a focus in Software Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far I have completed 3 coop semesters, and so far all my projects
        have been in the web, so I have some good experience in web development.
        I've worked on projects that use Angular and React, and right now I'm
        building a personal website that uses React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my favorite games are open-world games like Skyrim (a classic)
        and the Assasin's Creed series. I'm also really into Solitaire.
