# WEEK 1

### Assignment:

The goal for this project is to make sure you are familiar with setting up a web page.  Include some styling with CSS to make the page look unique and not so boring. You will create a simple web page with a brief paragraph about yourself (personal background, development experience, etc.), a list of some of your favorite games (or ones you are currently playing), and a picture of yourself. Once you are finished, make sure all of your code is pushed to a repository on github.com and submit the link to that repository.
