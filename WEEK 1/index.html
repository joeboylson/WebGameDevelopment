    <div id="about">
      <p>
        I'm a Junior in the School of Information Technology and I am going after a
        Bachelors degree with a focus in Software Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far I have completed 3 coop semesters, and so far all my projects
        have been in the web, so I'm very very excited for this class!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm really interested specifically in web development, because it combines
        the front-end, where a person can express their creativity through a visual
        interface, but it all comes from code and rules from the backend. I feel
        like its almost art with math - and I dig that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I'm a street photographer and I also do web development
        outside of work and school. I'm currently building a portfolio website.
