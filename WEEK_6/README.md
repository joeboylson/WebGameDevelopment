# WEEK 6: HANGMAN

In this assignment, I used a simple express app to host the page; it also provides the route to request the new word.

I did this because I was running into CORS issues using just a standard HTML page; this is the only was that I know if to get around the issue.

---

TO RUN THE APP:

1. Have node installed.

2. Go to the root of this application and run `npm install`:
  - this will install express and axios
    - express is used to host thw site
    - axios is the package used for making http requests

3. Run the application with `npm run start`.

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
